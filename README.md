# RBGOR2-Source

this is a repository for the code being used in a roblox game i've been working on for a few years called Random BattleGrounds of Randomness 2. 
this is a project that i've used as a base for learning the luau language as well as being my jumping-off point for understanding programming structure in general.

i will add to this overtime as i make progress and learn best practices for github.
